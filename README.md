## thought

* pazzle in Datalab require a lot careful thought.
* bomb lab and attack lab full of fun!
* it is strange that I did a little optimization in performance lab but gain full mark in autograper.
* shell lab use me a lot time on debug.
* most of my time spent on Malloc lab, which is the most diffcult part, I wrote 3 version of malloc, but it is sad that all of them only got 70 to 80 score.
* proxy lab more like a summarize to the before labs.
* an overview to the base of computer structure and computer system, learn a lot of UNIX programming
* whole learning use a month, most of the code are only 100 to 200 line, but waste much more time on debug.
